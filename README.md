# Capstone-Project
Platform game
We aim to develop a video game using either the Java programming language or the Unity game engine and toolset with the intent 
of providing a classic 2D platforming experience (think old school Mario and Sonic) with an action packed twist on gameplay. 
Although details of the game such as characters, plot, setting, levels and items unfortunately have not been decided on as of yet,
we would also consider incorporating the use of databases in some fashion to handle these types of elements in the game. 
As the project continues to progress we would like to use user feedback to guide further development.
